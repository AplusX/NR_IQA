==================================================================

This toolbox implements the algorithm described in: 

Zhou Wang and Eero P. Simoncelli, "Reduced-Reference Image
Quality Assessment Using A Wavelet-Domain Natural Image Statistic
Model," Human Vision and Electronic Imaging X, Proc. SPIE, vol.
5666, San Jose, CA, Jan. 2005.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

1) Download the required files, which include
   (i)   this zip file;
   (ii)  the matlabPyrTools for wavelet analysis (available at 
http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/software.html)
   (iii) Matlab optimization toolbox 

2) Unpack the zip file into a directory, respecting the original
tree structures of the package

3) Set Matlab path to inculde the wavelet analysis routines

4) Run the "test.m" program, which demonstrates clearly how the
other functions should be called
